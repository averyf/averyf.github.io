<p>Favorite Woman in Tech<p>
<p>My favorite woman in tech is Hedy Lamarr. She was an actress, but proved herself in the tech world as well. She helped to invent the spread-spectrum technology used to send radio signals from various frequencies. This technology helped the Navy be able to control objects remotely. In 1997, she was rewarded with the Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>	Why I joined GWC<p>
<p>I joined Girls Who Code because I did not know very much about technology and how computers really work. I wanted to get a basic idea of how to code because the computer science field is growing so fast, and there are more and more women in this field.</p>
<p>Why Coding is Important<p>
<p>I  think other girls should join because technology is becoming more and more important in our lives each day, and having a basic knowledge of how it works could be really helpful no matter what field of study you go into. It also gives girls the opportunity to meet other girls that have a similar passion as them and can teach the importance of working together.</p>
<p>Hobbies<p>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is photography! I love nature photography and taking portraits as well!</p></font>
